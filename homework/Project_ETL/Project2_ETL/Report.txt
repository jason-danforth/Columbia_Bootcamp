Our group used multiple CSVs from NYC Open Data that tracked cyclist and pedestrian traffice across the Brooklyn Bridge in NYC. 
Transforming the data required combining hourly data into daily data, clamping date ranges between the two data sets. 
The data was also normalized into separate dataframes with linked indices: cyclists, pedestrians, dates, and weekdays.
SQLAlchemy was used to create a DB and tables for the normalized data, input the data, and then query. 
As a quick test or the ETL pipeline, a query was made comparing pedestrian and cyclist traffic by day of week, temperature and precipitation.
The results show peaks on weekends and drops on the days with the most rain.
